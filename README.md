# Value Junk

This website was developed in 4 weeks (part-time) by 3 passionate Le Wagon students (Francis Servignat, Kylian Janssens and Sunny Law). The website is accessible via http://www.valuejunk.site/. 

The project idea was born after recognising the struggle of upcycling. Most of the time, people will throw away their junk instead of repairing or giving/selling them. However, the availability of the junk and help from craftspeople may not be obvious in the communities. ValueJunk brings these elements together to connect people to the junk market and to a pool of skilled craftpeople. 

Our vision was to provide ValueJunk with a project marketplace. People would gather around projects that they are interested in, creating teams, learning new skills, and make friends. We can think of projects like arts, humanitarian, gardening, or specific event like the 'Redbull Soapbox Races'.

## Features

**Landing page** – is an old telephone with light bulbs. This captures the purpose of the website of providing connectivity in the community sharing their bright ideas of upcycling projects. Scrolling down reviews the three main sections of the website (i.e. Market place, Craftspeople, and Projects) which is self-explanatory from the images and brief descriptions. 

**Logo**– The logo is two circles joined together reinforcing the idea of connnectivity. The circles represent a sustainable life cycle for junk. This logo is located on the top left and serves as a clickable icon to the home page.

**Navigation Bar** - the navigation bar blends in with the landing page taking the theme colors, shades of green throughout the website. It includes the three categories , 'Junk Market', 'Craftpeople', and 'Projects'. In addition, there is a quick access to 'Post an Ad'.
