# Value Junk

This website was developed in 4 weeks (part-time) by 3 passionate Le Wagon students (ie. Francis Servignat, Kylian Janssens, Sunny Law). ValueJunk website can be accessed via http://www.valuejunk.site/. 

The webpage was born from recognising nowadays people are concern about the environment and want to have a more sustainable ecosystem how to deal with junk.
Rather throwing them away, these can be upcycled. However, the availability of the junk and help from craftspeople may not be obvious in the communities. The webpage bring these elements together connecting to the junks and pool of talents. This can be expanded into bigger community projects revolving around events like the Soapbox racing.
