# Value Junk

This website was developed in 4 weeks (part-time) by 3 Le Wagon students (ie. Francis Servignat, Kylian Janssens, Sunny Law). ValueJunk website can be accessed via http://www.valuejunk.site/. 

The webpage was born from recognising nowadays people are concern about the environment and want to have a more sustainable ecosystem how to deal with junk.
Rather throwing them away, these can be upcycled. However, the availability of the junk and help from craftspeople may not be obvious in the communities. The webpage bring these elements together connecting to the junks and pool of talents. This can be expanded into bigger community projects revolving around events like the Soapbox racing.

## Feature

Landing page – is an old telephone with light bulbs capturing the purpose of the website to providing connectivity in the community for bright ideas of upcycling projects. Scrolling down reviews the three main sections (i.e. Market place, craftspeople, and projects) which is explanatory from the images and brief description. 

Logo and Navigation Bar – The logo is two circles joined together representing a sustainable life cycle for junk as suggested by the webpage name. The navigation bar blends in with the landing page taking the green theme colours through the pages.
